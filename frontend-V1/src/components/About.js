          <h2>What is Foundly?</h2>
          <p>
            Foundly is a smart and secure lost & found item management system built to reconnect people with their misplaced belongings. 
            Whether you're a student who lost a water bottle or someone who found a misplaced ID card, Foundly makes the process of reporting, tracking, and returning items smooth, simple, and stress-free.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Foundly?</h2>
          <p>
            Losing something shouldn’t feel like the end of the world — and finding something shouldn’t be a dead end. 
            We built Foundly to bridge the gap between seekers and finders in a more organized, transparent, and reliable way. 
            No more missing notice boards, endless emails, or confusion — just fast, fair, and secure item recovery.
